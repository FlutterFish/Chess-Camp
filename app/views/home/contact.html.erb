        <p>Unfortunately, the Chess Ability Reinforcement Services is not a real 
            website, but rather a sample project developed
            by Zehaotian Lin and Professor Heimann at Carnegie Mellon 
            University. We are sure that you wanted best chess camps 
            for your children from the most exquisite instructors on the 
            planet, but that's how it goes sometimes. If you are bitterly 
            disappointed<em>(and quite honestly, you should be)</em> and 
            want to grouse to someone, here's the contact information below.
